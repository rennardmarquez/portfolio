          I'm Rennard, a software developer & creative based in the Philippines.
          I make stuff (web apps) for the internet.

          Funny stuff, awesome stuff, or business stuff â€” I build anything a
          website conveys (frontend) & operates (backend). Efficiency & design
          is a must for my applications.
